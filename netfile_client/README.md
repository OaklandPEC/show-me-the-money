# Do this
```python
from netfile_client.NetFileClient import NetFileClient
nf = NetFileClient()
```

It will automatically load `NETFILE_API_KEY` and `NETFILE_API_SECRET` from a .env file.

Then you can do:
```python
nf.fetch('filings')
```

This fetches all filings. Currently configured endpoints are 'filings', 'filers', 'transactions', 'filing_activities', 'filing_elements', and 'elections'. You could concievably add any endpoint listed in the docs https://netfile.com/api/campaign/swagger/index.html. See the static `Routes` class for configured endpoints.

You can also pass keyword args to the `fetch` method and they will be sent as query parameters. For example, you could call `fetch` like `nf.fetch('transactions', FilingNid=somefilingid)` to get transactions for a particular filing. The client doesn't do any kind of validation on these parameters, it'll naively pass them along in the HTTP request.
